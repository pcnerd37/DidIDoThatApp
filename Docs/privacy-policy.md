# Privacy Policy for Did I Do That?

**Last Updated: December 30, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how "Did I Do That?" ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This app is designed with privacy in mind - your data stays on your device and under your control.

## Information We Collect

### Data You Provide
The app stores the following information that you create:
- **Task Information**: Task names, descriptions, categories, and frequency settings
- **Completion Records**: Dates and optional notes when you mark tasks as complete
- **Categories**: Custom category names and icons you create
- **App Settings**: Your notification preferences and reminder settings

### Automatically Collected Information
**We do not collect any personal information automatically.** The app does not:
- Track your location
- Access your contacts
- Collect device identifiers
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Send any data to our servers

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local Storage
All your data is stored **locally on your device** using a SQLite database. We do not have access to your data, and it is not transmitted to any external servers.

### Device Backup Services
Your app data may be included in your device's automatic backup:

- **Android**: If you have Google Backup enabled, your app data may be backed up to Google Drive. This is handled by Google according to their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **iOS**: If you have iCloud Backup enabled, your app data may be backed up to iCloud. This is handled by Apple according to their [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

These backups are encrypted and controlled by your device settings, not by our app.

### Export Feature
The app includes an optional export feature that allows you to save your data as a JSON file. When you use this feature:
- The file is created locally on your device
- You control where the file is saved or shared
- We do not receive or have access to exported files

## Permissions We Request

### Notifications (Optional)
The app requests permission to send local notifications to remind you about upcoming tasks. These notifications are:
- Generated entirely on your device
- Not sent through any external server
- Completely optional - the app works without this permission

### Internet Access
The app requests internet permission for potential future features but does not currently transmit any user data over the network.

## Third-Party Services

The current version of the app does **not** use any third-party services such as:
- Analytics platforms
- Advertising networks
- Crash reporting services
- Social media integrations

If we add third-party services in future versions, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.

## Data Retention

Your data remains on your device until:
- You delete specific tasks or categories within the app
- You uninstall the app
- You clear the app's data through your device settings

We do not retain any copy of your data since it is never transmitted to us.

## Children's Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is designed as a general utility and does not target children. Since all data is stored locally and we do not collect any personal information, there is no risk of children's data being shared with us.

## Your Rights

Since your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it:
- **Access**: View all your data within the app
- **Export**: Use the export feature to download your data as JSON
- **Delete**: Delete individual items or uninstall the app to remove all data
- **Portability**: Export and import your data between devices

## Security

Your data is protected by:
- Your device's built-in security features (screen lock, encryption)
- The app's sandboxed storage (other apps cannot access your data)
- Encrypted backups (if using Google Backup or iCloud)

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Providing notice within the app for significant changes

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
